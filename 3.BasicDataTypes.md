# 3. Basic Data Types

**Name and describe Go types categories?**

1. basic types  
numbers, strings, booleans.
2. aggregate types  
arrays, structs.
3. reference types  
pointers slices, maps, functions.
4. interface types  
?

## 3.1. Integers
**What are type and size of integers in go?**

* int, uint
* 8, 16, 32, 64

**What does the rune type mean and indicate?**

* rune mean int32
* the value is a Unicode code point

**What is uintptr?**  
An unsigned integer type that is large enough to hold the bit pattern of it's pointer.  
Used in low level programming.

**What is the range of values for a signed number of n bits?**  
From $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1}-1$

**What does this operators do?**

* &
* |
* ^
* &^
* <<
* \>>

---

* & bitwise AND
* | bitwise OR
* ^ bitwise XOR
* &^ bit clear (AND NOT)
* << left shift
* \>> right shift

**How can print a binary digits os a number with exaxtly 8 digits?**

```go
fmt.Printf("%08b\n" , x)
```

**How to reolve this error?**

```go
var apples int32 = 1
var oranges int16 = 2
var compote int = apples + oranges // compile error
```

---
By converting them to the same type

```go
var compote = int(apples) + int(oranges)
```
