# 3. Basic Data Types

**Name and describe Go types categories?**

1. basic types  
numbers, strings, booleans.
2. aggregate types  
arrays, structs.
3. reference types  
pointers slices, maps, functions.
4. interface types  
?

## 3.1. Integers

**What are type and size of integers in go?**

* int, uint
* 8, 16, 32, 64

**What does the rune type mean and indicate?**

* rune mean int32
* the value is a Unicode code point

**What is uintptr?**  
An unsigned integer type that is large enough to hold the bit pattern of it's pointer.  
Used in low level programming.

**What is the range of values for a signed number of n bits?**  
From $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1}-1$

**What does this operators do?**

* &
* |
* ^
* &^
* <<
* \>>

---

* & bitwise AND
* | bitwise OR
* ^ bitwise XOR
* &^ bit clear (AND NOT)
* << left shift
* \>> right shift

**How can print a binary digits os a number with exaxtly 8 digits?**

```go
fmt.Printf("%08b\n" , x)
```

**How to reolve this error?**

```go
var apples int32 = 1
var oranges int16 = 2
var compote int = apples + oranges // compile error
```

---
By converting them to the same type

```go
var compote = int(apples) + int(oranges)
```

## 3.2. FloatingPoint Numbers

**What are go's floating point number types? What are the limitatoin?**  
float32, float64  
float32 has aprroximately 6 decimal digits, and flot64 has 15 digits.  
float32 is very limited, smallest positive integer that cannot be exactly represented as a float32 is not large. it is "16777216". Do not use it!!!

**How do numbers in float32 convert in bits?**

* first bit is sign bit. 0 means positive and 1 means negative
* the next 8 bits are exponent bits(in base 2 and biased by 127)
* the last 23 bits are the fraction.The fraction is normalized, which means that there is an implicit leading 1 before the decimal point
* the formula is: $float32 = sign*2^{exponent - 127}*(1 + fraction)$  
Here are some examples:

| Number | Float32 in bits | formula |
| ------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1      | 00111111100000000000000000000000 | (+1) x 2^(0) x (1.0) |
| 2      | 01000000000000000000000000000000 | (+1) x 2^(1) x (1.0) |
| 3      | 01000000010000000000000000000000 | (+1) x 2^(1) x (1.5) |
| 0.25   | 00111101100000000000000000000000 | (+1) x 2^(-4) x (1.0) |
| 100000000 | 01011001100110011001100110011010 |  (+1) x 2^(52) x (1.19921875) |
| 0      | 00000000000000000000000000000000  | ~~(+1) x 2^(-127) x (1 + 0)~~ > (+1) x 2^(-126) x (0) |

0 is a special case called a denormalized number, which means that the fraction is not normalized and there is no implicit leading 1 before the decimal point. In this case, the fraction is actually 0, and the exponent is actually -126. That's why 0 is represented by all zeros in float32.

## 3.3. Complex Numbers

**How many size of Complex Numbers exit? How should define a complex number?**  
complex64 and complex128

```go
var x complex128 = complex(1, 2) // 1+2i
var y complex128 = complex(3, 4) // 3+4i
x := 1 + 2i
y := 3 + 4i
```

## 3.4. Booleans

**Write a conversion function from a boolean to numeric?**  

```go
func btoi(b bool) int {
    if b {
        return 1
    }
    retrun 0
}
```

**Write a conversion function from a numeric to boolean?**  

```go
func itob(i int) bool {
    return i!=0
}
```

## 3.5. Strings

**What does len function do?**  
It reutrns number of bytes(not runes) in a string.

### 3.5.1. String Literals

**What are escape sequences? give some examples**  
Within double quoted string literal, escape sequences thab beging with backslash \ can be used to insert arbitrary byte values into string.

* \a ‘‘alert’’ or bell
* \b backspace
* \f form feed
* \n newline
* \r carriage retur n
* \t tab
* \v vertical tab
* \' single quote (only in the rune literal '\'')
* \" double quote (only within "..." literals)
* \\ backslash

**What is raw string literal?**  
A raw string literal is written `...`, using backquotes instead of double quotes.  
Within a raw string literal, no escap e sequences are processed.

## 3.5.2. Unicode

**What is ASCII?**  
ASCII or American Standard Code for Informat ion Interchange, it the first charachter sets.  
It uses 7 bits to represent 128 charachters.

**What is unicode?**  
Unicode is next generataion of ASCII,
It's rune in Go, which is cal le d UTF-32 or UCS-4 and it usese 32 bits.

## 3.5.3. UTF8

**What is UTF-8? How it displays charcters?**  

UTF-8 is a varialbe-length encoding of Unicode points as bytes.  
It uses between 1 to 4 bytes to represent each ruen.

| Prefix | Code point range | Decimal range |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| 0xxxxxx | 0−127 | 0−127 (ASCII) |
| 11xxxxx 10xxxxxx | 128−2047 | (values <128 unused) |
| 110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx | 2048−65535 | (values <2048 unused) |
| 1110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx | 65536−0x10ffff | (other values unused) |

**What is replacement character?**  
Each time a UTF-8 decoder, whether explicit in a call to utf8.DecodeRuneInString or implicit in a range loop, consumes an unexpected input byte, it generates a special Unicode replacement character, '\uFFFD', which is usually printed as a white question mark inside a black hexagonal or diamond-like shape .

**How cancount the number of runes in a string?**
utf8.RuneCountInString(s)

## 3.5.4. Strings and Byte Slices

**What are four standard packages are particularly important for manipulating strings:?**

* bytes:  
  The bytes package has similar functions for manipulat ing slices of bytes, of type []byte, which share some properties with strings.  
  Because strings are immutable, building up strings incrementally can involve a lot of allocat ion and copying.
* strconv:  
  provides functions for converting boolean, integer, and floating-point values to and from their string representations
* unicode:  
  provides functions like IsDigit, IsLetter, IsUpper, and IsLower for classifying runes
* strings:  
  has similar functions, also called ToUpper and ToLower, that return a new string with the specified transformat ion applied to each character of the original string

**To avoid conversions and unnecessary memory allocation, many of the utility functions in the bytes package do what?**  
The bytes package directly parallel their counterparts in the strings package:

* func Contains(s, substr string) bool
* func Count(s, sep string) int
* func Fields(s string) []string
* func HasPrefix(s, prefix string) bool
* func Index(s, sep string) int
* func Join(a []string, sep string) string

### 3.5.5. Conversions between Strings and Numbers

**How to convert an integer to a string?**  
To convert an integer to a string, one option is to use fmt.Sprintf;  
another is to use the function strconv.Itoa (‘‘integer to ASCII’’):

```golang
x := 123
y := fmt.Sprintf("%d", x)
fmt.Println(y, strconv.Itoa(x)) // "123 123"
```

**How to formant numbers in a different base?**  
FormatInt and FormatUint can be used to format numbers in a different base:

```golang
fmt.Println(strconv.FormatInt(int64(x), 2)) // "1111011"  
```

The fmt.Printf verbs %b, %d, %u, and %x are often more convenient than Format functions, especially if we want to include additional informat ion besides the number:

```golang
s := fmt.Sprintf("x=%b", x) // "x=1111011"
```

**What function can parse a string representing an integer?**  
To parse a string representing an integer, use the strconv functions Atoi or ParseInt, or ParseUint for unsig ned integers:

```golang
x, err := strconv.Atoi("123") // x is an int
y, err := strconv.ParseInt("123", 10, 64) // base 10, up to 64 bits
```

## 3.6. Constants

**What is output of this snippet?**

```golang
            const (  
            a = 1
            b
            c = 2
            d
            )
            fmt.Println(a, b, c, d) 
```

---

```"1 1 2 2"```

### 3.6.1. The Constant Generator iota

**What is The Constant Generator iota?**  
A const declaration may use the constant generator iota, which is used to create a sequence of related values without spelling out each one explicitly.  
In a const declaration, the value of iota begins at zero and increments by one for each item in the sequence.

```golang
type Weekday int
const (
Sunday Weekday = iota
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
)
```

### 3.6.2. Untyped Constants

**What are Untyped Constants?**  
We can have constants that are not committed to a particular type.  
They can have more precision and don't need conversions.
