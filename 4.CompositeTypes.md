# 4 Composite Types

**What are composite types? What are the differecnes?**

```list
    * Arrays
    * Slices
    * Maps
    * Structs
```

* Arrays and Structs are fixed size and aggregate types. Their values are concatenations of other values in Memory.
* Arrays are homogeneous. Structs are hetrogeneous.
* Maps and Slices are dynamic data structures.

## 4.1. Arrays

**Write a function that zeroes the contents of a[32]byte array?**

```golang
func zero(ptr *[32]byte) {
range i := range ptr {
ptr[i] = 0
}
}

//or
func zero(ptr *[32]byte) {
    *ptr = [32]byte{}
}
```

**define a array using ellipsis ‘‘...’’ and another with explicit type?**  
```q := [...]int{1, 2, 3}```
```var q [3]int```

**Print the indices and elements of a matrix "a".**  

```go
for i , v := range(a) {
    fmt.printf("%d %d\n" , i , v)
}
 ```

## 4.2. Slices

**What is slice? How can defina a slice?**

* slices are homonenous variable length sequence
* is defined by  `[]T`, where the elements types are T
* it looks like an array without size
* examples:
  * `s = []int(nil) // len(s) == 0, s == nil`
  * `s = []int{} // creates an empty slice of integers, len(s) == 0, s != nil`

**What is slice operator?**

* Slice operator, `s[i:j]` creates a new slice that refer to element `i` to `j-1` of sequence s
* S can be an array variable, pointer to an array or another slice
* example:
  * `Q2 := months[4:7]`

**Write a function to reverse the order of slice?**

```golang
func reverse(s []int) {
    for i,j := 0 , len(s)-1; i<j, i,j = i+1 , j-1 {
        s[i] , s[j] = s[j] , s[i]
    }
}
```

**Use reverese function to to rotate a slice left by n elements?**

```golang
reverse(s[:n])
reverse(s[n:])
reverse(s)
```

**Why "==" doesn't work for for slices?**

* elements of slice are indirect and it make slice to contain itself
* the == operator for slices only checks if the pointers to the underlying arrays are equal, not if the elements are equal.

**What does the built-in function make create?**  
It creates a slice:  
```make([]T, len, cap)// same as make([]T, cap)[:len]```

**What does this do?**  
>> `make([]int, 3)[3:]`

---
It creates a slice of integers with capcity of 3 and length of 0.  
It is equals to `make([]int, 0 , 3)`
