# 4 Composite Types

**What are composite types? What are the differecnes?**

```list
    * Arrays
    * Slices
    * Maps
    * Structs
```

* Arrays and Structs are fixed size and aggregate types. Their values are concatenations of other values in Memory.
* Arrays are homogeneous. Structs are hetrogeneous.
* Maps and Slices are dynamic data structures.

## 4.1. Arrays

**Write a function that zeroes the contents of a[32]byte array?**

```golang
func zero(ptr *[32]byte) {
range i := range ptr {
ptr[i] = 0
}
}

//or
func zero(ptr *[32]byte) {
    *ptr = [32]byte{}
}
```

**define a array using ellipsis ‘‘...’’ and another with explicit type?**  
```q := [...]int{1, 2, 3}```
```var q [3]int```

**Print the indices and elements of a matrix "a".**  

```go
for i , v := range(a) {
    fmt.printf("%d %d\n" , i , v)
}
 ```

## 4.2. Slices

**What is slice? How can defina a slice?**

* slices are homonenous variable length sequence
* is defined by  `[]T`, where the elements types are T
* it looks like an array without size
* examples:
  * `s = []int(nil) // len(s) == 0, s == nil`
  * `s = []int{} // creates an empty slice of integers, len(s) == 0, s != nil`

**What is slice operator?**

* Slice operator, `s[i:j]` creates a new slice that refer to element `i` to `j-1` of sequence s
* S can be an array variable, pointer to an array or another slice
* example:
  * `Q2 := months[4:7]`

**Write a function to reverse the order of slice?**

```golang
func reverse(s []int) {
    for i,j := 0 , len(s)-1; i<j; i,j = i+1 , j-1 {
        s[i] , s[j] = s[j] , s[i]
    }
}
```

**Use reverese function to to rotate a slice left by n elements?**

```golang
reverse(s[:n])
reverse(s[n:])
reverse(s)
```

**Why "==" doesn't work for for slices?**

* elements of slice are indirect and it make slice to contain itself
* the == operator for slices only checks if the pointers to the underlying arrays are equal, not if the elements are equal.

**What does the built-in function make create?**  
It creates a slice:  
```make([]T, len, cap)// same as make([]T, cap)[:len]```

**What does this do?**  
>> `make([]int, 3)[3:]`

---
It creates a slice of integers with capcity of 3 and length of 0.  
It is equals to `make([]int, 0 , 3)`

### 4.2.1. The append Function

**What does append function do?**  
Append will add elements to another slice
`runes = append(runes, r)`  
It is not straightforward because it needs expansion. len and capacity are not pointers.

**What is variadic function?**  
The ellipsis ‘‘...’’ in the declaration of appendInt makes the function variadic:  
it accepts any number of final arguments.  
`func appendInt(x []int, y ...int) []int { //some code}`  

## 4.2.2. InPlace Slice Techniques

**write a function returns a slice holding only the nonempty strings.**

```golang
func nonempty(s []string) []string
i :=0
_, v := range s {
    if v != nil {
        s[i]=v
        i++        
    }
return s[:i]
}
```

```golang
func nonempty2(s []string) []string
out := []string[:0]
_, v := range s {
    if v != nil {
        out = append(out , v)        
    }
return out
}
```

**Write one snippt that push a new value to a stack, and two functions that pop the i'th element from the middle of it, one with keeping the order, and the other without.**

```golang
slack = append(slack , v) //push value
func popout {s []int , i int} []int {
    copy(slice[i:],slice[i+1:])
    remove(slice[:len(slice)-1])

}

func popoutunordered {s []int , i int} []int {
    copy(slice[i],slice[len(slice)-1])
    remove(slice[:len(slice)-1])

}
```

## 4.3. Maps

**What is hash table?**  
It is an unordered collection of key/value pairs in which all the keys are distinct

**How a Map defined? What are the restrictions?**  
Map is a reference to a hash table, and a map type is written map[K]V, where K and V
are the types of its keys and values.  
All of the keys in a given map are of the same type, and all of the values are of the same type  
There are no restrictions on the value type V.

**In which ways a Map is defined?**  
The built-in function make can be used to create a map:

```golang
ages := make(map[string]int) // mapping from strings to ints
```  

We can also use a map literal to create a new map populated with some initial key/value pairs:

```golang
ages := map[string]int{
"alice": 31,
"charlie": 34,
} 
```

**Why can't we take map's address?**  
But a map element is not a variable, and we cannot take its address:

```golang
_ = &ages["bob"] // compile error: cannot take address of map element
```

One reason that we can’t take the address of a map element is that growing a map might cause rehashing of existing elements into new storage locations, thus potentially invalid ating the address.

**`age, ok := ages["bob"]`?**  
 It is used to check if a map named ages has a key named "bob" and assign the value associated with that key to a variable named age.  
 The variable ok is a boolean that indicates whether the key was found or not.  
 If the key "bob" is not in the map, then age will be zero and ok will be false.
**map comparison?**  
As with slices, maps cannot be compared to each other ;  
The only legal comparison is with nil.  
To test whether two maps contain the same keys and the same associated values, we must write a loop:

```golang
func equal(x, y map[string]int) bool {
if len(x) != len(y) {
return false
}
for k, xv := range x {
if yv, ok := y[k]; !ok || yv != xv {
return false
}
}
return true
}
```

**What is set?**  
 a built-in data type that can store a collection of unique values, such as  
 {1, 2, 3}  
 or  
 {"red", "green", "blue"}
