# 2. Program Structure

## 2.1. Names

>**What is the rules for namning in go?**

The names in go begin with a letter or underscore and can have many letters, digits & underscores
***
>**What's difference when in entity is declared within a function? What'd visibility boundries?**

When an entity is defined inside a function it't local but when it's definid in a program it can be seen by all function belong to that package.
If the first letter is upper case, it is exporterd and it can be seen by other packages as well.

## 2.2. Declarations

>**How many declations are in go?**

4

var, const, type, func

## 2.3. Variables

>**What is the general form of var decleration?**

```go
var name type = expression
```

### 2.3.1. Short Variable Declarations

>**How to defien a varialbe in Short Variable Declarations mode?**

```go
i  := 0
i, j := 0, 1
```

### 2.3.2. Pointers

>**What is pointer? How can define it? How to update it**
Pointer value is the adress of a variable.

```go
    x := 1
    p := &x // p, of type *int, points to x
    fmt.Println(*p) // "1"
    *p = 2 // equivalent to x = 2
    fmt.Println(x) // "2"
```



>**What is result of this snippet?**

```go
    var x, y int
    fmt.Println(&x == &x, &x == &y, &x == nil)
```

> *Answer*

The zero value for a pointer of any typ e is nil. 

The test p != nil is true if p points to a variable.

Pointers are comparable; two pointers are equal if and only if they point to the same
var iable or both are nil.

```go
// "true false false"
```



>**Define a function that return the address of a local variable?**

```go
    var p = f()
    func f() *int {
    v := 1
    return &v
    }
```
>**Define a function that takes the address of a local variable?**

```go
    func incr(p *int) int {
    *p++ // increments what p points to; does not change p
    return *p
    }
    v := 1
    incr(&v) // side effect: v is now 2
    fmt.Println(incr(&v)) // "3" (and v is 3)
```

### 2.3.3. The new Function

>**How can we create a variable by using new function?**
by using new(T), an unnamed variable type T will be created

```go
p := new(int) // p, of type *int, points to an unnamed int variable
fmt.Println(*p) // "0"
*p = 2 // sets the unnamed int to 2
fmt.Println(*p) // "2"
```

>**Why the new function is relatively rarely used?**

Because the most common unnamed variables are of struct types, for which the struct literal syntax is more flexible

### 2.3.4. Lifetime of Variables

>**ÙŒWhat is the lifetime of package-level and local variables?**
The lifetime of package-level variables is the entire execution of the program.
The lifetime of local variables is dynamic, until it becomes unreachalbe.
